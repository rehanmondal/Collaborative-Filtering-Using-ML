### Introduction 
The main purpose of a Recommendation system it'll suggest items to users effortlessly making their existence less complicated. Today the amount of information with inside the internet very unexpectedly and people want few gadgets to are trying to find out and get right of entry to suitable information. One among such tool is used named recommendation system. Recommendation Engines endorse products to the customers which are maximum applicable to that specific user. In recent times, online e book advertising and marketing web sites compete with one another in a diffusion of approaches. One of the maximum effective strategies for growing advantage and keeping clients is a advice framework, which could recommend books which are of interest to the user. So the fundamental reason for this task is to guide folks that have an interest in studying and to influence the ones individuals who are inculcating the addiction of studying. By way of constructing a e book recommendation engine we generally tend to purpose to assist humans opt for the right e-book that interests them and so encouraging them to examine more. With the assistance of statistics sets and system learning we believe we can select the proper book for someone supported their pastimes and additionally the facts from numerous exceptional readers. Therefore here we use a <code><b>Collaborative Filtering System</b></code> introduced by by <code>Machine Learning.</code>

### Project Overview
➥	In this book recommendation system we recommend similar books to the reader based on their interest.<br>
➥	The book recommendation system is used by online websites which provide eBooks like Google play books, open library etc.<br>
➥	K nearest Neighbor Algorithm is used to execute the program where the filtering involves the analysis of the opinions in which the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recommendation is provided based on the ratings provided by the users. The quality of the item cannot be analyzed in the content based  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filtering. But the it can expose the quality of the item.<br>

➥ The next process is to train the overall model for which iI have used python language with popular libraries numpy,pandas, scikit learn.   
➥ In interest degree, interest is the characteristic of the book itself, and it is recommended from the perspective of attractiveness to the target &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;user. It includes the interest of the book itself and the interest of the user. Book interest refers to the attributes of the book itself, including &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;search times, borrowing time, borrowing interval, borrowing times, and renewing times. User interest refers to books that users like, books &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that have already been borrowed, and so on.
### Data Sets :
➥	The csv data are taken from <b>kaggle.com</b>.Taken these three datasets:<br>
       • <code>Books.csv</code> - Contains information about books which contain all the information related to books like an author, title, publication year, etc.<br>• <code>Ratings.csv</code> - Ratings contain information like which user has given how much rating to which book.<br>•  <code>User.csv</code> - It contains registered user’s information like user id, location.

### Background study   
➥ The recommendation users get may not be mined from the data at all but contributed by other users. There are three main steps:<br>
• &nbsp;&nbsp;	Collecting scoring data, <br>
• &nbsp;&nbsp;	Finding neighbors, <br>
• &nbsp;&nbsp;	Generating a recommendation list.<br>
• &nbsp;&nbsp;	Data sets Filtering<br>
• &nbsp;&nbsp;	Records sorting<br>
• &nbsp;&nbsp;	Matrix creation<br>
• &nbsp;&nbsp;	Array, List forming<br>

### Preprocessing Data 
In the books file, we have some extra columns which are not required for our task like image URLs. And we will rename the columns of each file as the name of the column contains space, and uppercase letters so we will correct as to make it easy to use.
Have to remove "Missing" values, redundant values,remove outliers etc.
